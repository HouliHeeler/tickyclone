Personal Project replication of TickyBot

In this code, I am building a replication of the TickyBot website in order to showcase some ability with HTML, CSS, and vanilla Javascript.

The website will do the following:

-display the content intended for the user to see
-showcase some CSS Animations
-use Javascript functions to enable a 'Scroll to Top' button and let some of the content/animations load on scrolling to their specific section of the DOM



Challenges Encountered

Even with a basic site like Tickybot, there were many things I had to go through and learn. Specifically the Javascript functions were a lot of Googling, understanding, and passing in my own code to cater it to my needs.

The CSS Animations were all brand new to me, but were a delight to learn.

A challenge that I didn't go back and re-visit on account of time constraints, was re-factoring the CSS. While it does everything I want, I think it would be very possible to condense a lot of it, making it easier to read and edit.




This project was a lot of fun to work on, and I hope my future endeavors are just as captivating!
